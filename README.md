# DKB-Export

 - This is an export script that someone else (hoffie, tom08) wrote, so you should read and understand the source!
 - I forked this to maintain it and I wanted to have my own version that I read and understood completely. See above.

# Foundations

 - [dkb-visa from hoffie](https://github.com/hoffie/dkb-visa) is the basis for all of this.
 - [dkbweb from tom08z](https://code.google.com/p/dkbweb/) Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/dkbweb and not written by me (inktrap). This needs dkb-visa which is already integrated in my version.

# Installation

 - create a virtualenv and activate it.
 - ``pip install mechanize beautifulsoup4``

# Usage

 - see README-dkb-visa-hoffie.rst for now
